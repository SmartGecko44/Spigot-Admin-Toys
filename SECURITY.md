## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Contact:** Reach out to the project maintainer on Discord (`smartgecko44`) to report any security concerns.

2. **Response Time:** You can expect to receive an initial response after at most a day, depending on the time here in Germany. The time taken to address the vulnerability will depend on its severity.

3. **Vulnerability Assessment:** The reported vulnerability will be assessed to determine its validity and severity.

4. **Patch Release:** If the vulnerability is accepted and confirmed, a patch will be developed and released. The patch release schedule will be communicated to the reporter.

**Note:** Security patches will only be released for the latest version (`4.0.0`). No security patches are planned for versions below `4.0.0` at the moment.

Your cooperation in responsibly reporting vulnerabilities is appreciated. Thank you for helping to keep this project secure.
